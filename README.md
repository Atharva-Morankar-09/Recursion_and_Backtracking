# Recursion_and_Backtracking

Recursion : 
recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. Recursion solves such recursive problems by using functions that call themselves from within their own code.
Ways to identify/Solve : 1) Choices + Decision 2) IBH (Induction, base, hypothesis) 3)IP/OP (Making I/P 0) 4) Starting from 0 till size of string etc.

Backtracking :
Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons a candidate as soon as it determines that the candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.
